# Themes
These are pre-packaged and somewhat tested themes. Provided you don't use a broken version of spicetify, you should be able to at least *use* spotify with these themes installed. Some of them won't necessarily look good due to mismatched and out of date versions (see the warning in the README).

## Official Themes
All of these themes can be found [here.](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes)
### Default
Identical to the default look of spotify, but with other colorschemes available.
### BurntSienna
Grey and orange theme using the montserrat typeface.
### Dreary
Flat design, with lots of thick line borders.
### Dribbblish
Modern, rounded, and minimal design, with fading effects and gradients.
### Flow
Monochromatic colorschemes with subtle differences between colors, and soft vertical gradients.
### Glaze
Simple theme which gives spotify a simpler design and a single highlight color.
### Onepunch
Gruvbox.
### Sleek
Flat design, with dark blues for the background and single highlight colors in each scheme.
### Turntable
